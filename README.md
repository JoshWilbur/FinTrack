# FinTrack
The FinTrack project has been brewing in my head for a bit. I aim to create a web-based budget manager which can be easily used by anyone. The details are still a bit muddy at the moment. Listed below is my current plan for FinTrack. I plan to 
capture the entire development process in this repository. 

Initial plan:
* Mock out website layout
* Determine a "selling point" to focus on
* Set up kanban-like board to break down the project
* Plan and develop front-end
* Plan and develop back-end
* Add unit tests to both ends
* Create a yaml build-action script 
* Database for users? If so, look into authentication 
* Host website on GitHub
