# FinTrack
The FinTrack project has been brewing in my head for a bit. I aim to create a web-based budget manager that also includes other finance tools. Down the road it would be nice to make this into stand alone app. I plan to capture the entire development process in this repository.

Initial Plan:
* Mock out website layout using Figma
* Break down project into smaller chunks
* Plan and develop front-end
* Plan and develop back-end
* Add unit tests to both ends
* If needed, create a yaml build-action script
* Host website on GitHub

Desired Features:
* Budget calculator: weekly/monthly/yearly, categorize income and expenses, recurring fees
* Financial calculators: basic, net income/worth, loan payment, compound interest, currency conversion

Future Additions:
* Database for users? If so, look into authentication 
* Financial goal setting (saving/debt plan)
* Basic stock and/or portfolio analysis?
