# FinTrack
I aim to create a web-based budget manager that also includes other finance tools. This will be pretty basic to start, won't be anything fancy for the website. I plan to capture the entire development process in this repository.

Initial Plan:
* Front end: design basic HTML site
* Plan and develop back-end
* Add unit tests to both ends
* If needed, create a yaml build-action script
* Host website on GitHub

Desired Features:
* Budget calculator: weekly/monthly/yearly, categorize income and expenses, recurring fees
* Financial calculators: basic, net income/worth, loan payment, compound interest, currency conversion

Future Additions:
* Database for users? If so, look into authentication 
* Financial goal setting (saving/debt plan)
* Basic stock and/or portfolio analysis?
